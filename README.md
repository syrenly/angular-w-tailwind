# AngularWTailwind

👋 Hi, I’m @syrenly and welcome to **angular-w-tailwind** repo!

This is a sample app that uses Tailwind and DaisyUI frameworks.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2, currently updated to version 17.3.1.

⚗️ Some unit tests implemented. 🚧 I'm working on it! 🚧

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage` to get stats about the code coverage. Current:

```
=============================== Coverage summary ===============================
Statements   : 62.06% ( 18/29 )
Branches     : 0% ( 0/4 )
Functions    : 80% ( 4/5 )
Lines        : 56% ( 14/25 )
================================================================================
```

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
